# Blockchain
## What is blockchain? 
> Blockchain is the modern and secure way to store data in the ledger, and every segment of data itâ€™s called a block. Also,  Blockchain is a series of data blocks, where the validity of each succeeding block is dependent upon the previous block (and thus on all previous blocks).

## How the program work ? 
This application will ask the user to use three processes, and the program should not start processing the blocks and ledgers unless process number three is initialized. For instance, you should determine which process you want to use after you run the program using the terminal.
``` java -cp ".;gson-2.8.2.jar" BlockChain 0 ``` 
``` java -cp ".;gson-2.8.2.jar" BlockChain 1 ``` 
``` java -cp ".;gson-2.8.2.jar" BlockChain 2 ```
